        <title>Like an expensive sports car</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Like an expensive sports car, fine-tuned and well-built, Portia was sleek,
shapely, and gorgeous, her red jumpsuit moulding her body, which was as warm
as seatcovers in July, her hair as dark as new tires, her eyes flashing like
bright hubcaps, and her lips as dewy as the beads of fresh rain on the hood;
she was a woman driven – fueled by a single accelerant – and she needed a
man, a man who wouldn’t shift from his views, a man to steer her along the
right road: a man like Alf Romeo.
		– Rachel Sheeley, winner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hair ball blocking the drain of the shower reminded Laura she would never
see her little dog Pritzi again.
		– Claudia Fields, runner-up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could have been an organically based disturbance of the brain – perhaps a
tumor or a metabolic deficiency – but after a thorough neurological exam it
was determined that Byron was simply a jerk.
		– Jeff Jahnke, runner-up&lt;/p&gt;

night.”  The object of the contest is to write the opening sentence of the
worst possible novel.&lt;/p&gt;
